      <description>Profile My experience is varied however I have found myself enjoying challenging tasks, whether it be maintaining the balance between the customer-business relationship or following specific criteria to design and create real world solutions to problems. I believe if I run into a problem, I can find a way to work through it in the most efficient and productive way.
Expertise and software experience I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a L1/L2 Technical Support and Server Administrator for 18 months.</description>

      <description>About me Hi there,
My name is Cam.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a stream of consciousness and a little about what lead me to IT.
I spent a lot of time doing very hard manual labour in some pretty average places, the best being a stint in a heat treatment plant. I was tasked, with my friend Tomas, to restore an old steel quenching furnace. This is the process of cooking steel at 900 degrees, and then dropping it into hot oil.</description>
